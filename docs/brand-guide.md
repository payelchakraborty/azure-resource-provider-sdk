#Add-on Branding Guide

We want to make your offering look as attractive as possible in the Azure Store. Please follow these guidelines as you develop your logos.

> Our designers can work with you to create logos that meet the requirements in this guide. > Please e-mail us your logo in EPS or PSD format at <wastorepartners@microsoft.com>

##Logo Sizes
We need the following logo sizes for your offering:

* Small logo should be of size 40 X 40 px
* Medium logo should be of size 90 X 90 px
* Large logo should be of size 115 X 115 px
* Wide logo should be of size 255 X 115 px
* Hero logo should be of size 815 X 290 px

##Logo Look and Feel

* The Azure design has a simple color palette. Keep the number of primary and secondary colors on your logo low.
* Logos should not be placed on a white background. We recommend simple primary colors or transparent backgrounds.
* **Do not use a gradient background** on the logo.
* Avoid placing text, even your company or brand name, on the logo. 
* The look and feel of your logo should be 'flat' and should avoid gradients.
* The logo should not be stretched.

<b>Additional guidelines for the Hero logo banner:<b/>

* The Hero logo is optional. You can choose not to upload a Hero logo.<br\>
* The publisher display name, SKU title, the offer long summary and the create button are embedded automatically inside the Hero logo once the offer goes live. So you do not have to enter them while you are designing the Hero logo.<br\>
* As the Publisher Display Name, SKU title and the offer long summary are displayed in white font color, you should avoid keeping the background of the Hero Icon as white, or any light color.<br\>
* You should leave space for the above text on the top of the Hero Icon. The space for the text is 415x100 and it is offset by 370px from the left.<br\>

These logos should be uploaded to the (Publishing Portal.)[https://publish.windowsazure.com]
